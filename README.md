# PatheticMustan

I'm Pathetic... Mustan Pathetic.

  <summary>🌟 About Me</summary>
  
  Mustan Pathetic is a fun unique name I thought of. Originally when I searched for "Mustan", all I got were cars! :(
  I kept hearing "Pathetic" so I used it in place of a last name. Now whenever somebody calls me pathetic, I can say "PATHETIC MUSTAN HAHAHHAHAHA"
  
  You may also find me as "Natsumi". Natsumi backwards is "imustan", because I'm Mustan, :)
  
  I like making fun little projects. I hope one day I'll finally know what I'm doing.

  I tinkered with the sizes and strength for a while until I got a result I liked.
