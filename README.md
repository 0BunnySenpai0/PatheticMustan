  <summary>🌟 About Me</summary>
  
  Mustan Pathetic is a fun unique name I thought of. Originally when I searched for "Mustan", all I got were cars! :(
  I kept hearing "Pathetic" so I used it in place of a last name. Now whenever somebody calls me pathetic, I can say "PATHETIC MUSTAN HAHAHHAHAHA"
  
  You may also find me as "Natsumi". Natsumi backwards is "imustan", because I'm Mustan, :)
  
  I like making fun little projects. I hope one day I'll finally know what I'm doing.
  
  I'm also the creator of [Prodigy-Hacking/ProdigyMathGameHacking](https://github.com/Prodigy-Hacking/ProdigyMathGameHacking).
  For proof, [PatheticMustan/ProdigyMathGameHacking](https://github.com/PatheticMustan/ProdigyMathGameHacking) redirects to the official Prodigy-Hacking repo.

  <summary>🤳 Profile Picture</summary>
  
  To make my profile picture, I used [Arbitrary Style Transfer in the Browser](https://reiinakano.com/arbitrary-image-stylization-tfjs/).
  
  Photos Used:
  
  | Name | Image |

  | Style | <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PatheticMustan/PatheticMustan/master/Uploads/original-profile.jpg"> |
  | Result | <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PatheticMustan/PatheticMustan/master/Uploads/greenKenji.png"> |

  I tinkered with the sizes and strength for a while until I got a result I liked.
