  <summary>About Me</summary>
  
  Mustan Pathetic is a fun pseudonym I use. Nobody else uses it, so bonus!
  
  You may also find me as "Natsumi". Natsumi backwards is "imustan", because I'm Mustan, haha ðŸ˜‰
  
  I know web design, JS, and tiny bit of Java/Python. I like making fun little projects, but it's hard to stay so motivated!
  
  I also made apps with React Native. ðŸ˜„
